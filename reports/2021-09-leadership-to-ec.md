# September 2021 Trainer Leadership Report to EC

__Summary__
In the first six months, we have focused on gettig up an running.  We established protocols for working
publicly to maintain high transparency and we started our work on outstanding matters: governance, 
the trainer agreement, and IT Curriculum Maintainance.  Going forward, we'll continue on these matters
mostly with the goal of setting up for the next 1 year term to be a more visionary period with more 
basic matters settled and functional working practices in place. 


## Leadership Setup

We used the first sessions of the Leadership meetings to outline how this new Leadership group should function. We adopted a variation on Marthas Rules for running our meetings, and developed a procedure for taking and sharing minutes that prioritizes transparency and openness. We elected to do most of our work in GitHub, and have set up a number of templates for issues and pull requests to improve ease of use and to encourage discussion and feedback in this medium.

## Trainer Agreement Update Process
In 2020, the Trainer community raised concerns about the language in the updated Trainer agreement, 
in particular the requirement to meet a specified number of units. To avoid a similar situation 
occurring again, the Trainer leadership team proposed forming a working group to formalise the 
consultation and feedback process around future agreement updates. The group prepared terms of 
reference and a timeline for this project, and sought members from the community to make up the 
working group. Unfortunately there was minimal response to this call, and in light of this and 
other activities around updating the agreement, the working group was not formed. Instead, the 
Trainers leadership group will work directly with the Director of Instructor Training to review 
future agreement versions.

## Checkout Process Governance

We are in the process of outlining a process for making changes to Trainer Checkout. This document would specify what kinds of changes can be made by which groups, and when decisions require a vote by the Trainer Community. Currently we are identifying stakeholders for various parts of the checkout process, and working to determine who would own the Checkout Governance.
