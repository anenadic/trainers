Trainer Agreement Update Process
In 2020, the Trainer community raised concerns about the language in the updated Trainer agreement, 
in particular the requirement to meet a specified number of units. To avoid a similar situation 
occurring again, the Trainer leadership team proposed forming a working group to formalise the 
consultation and feedback process around future agreement updates. The group prepared terms of 
reference and a timeline for this project, and sought members from the community to make up the 
working group. Unfortunately there was minimal response to this call, and in light of this and 
other activities around updating the agreement, the working group was not formed. Instead, the 
Trainers leadership group will work directly with the Director of Instructor Training to review 
future agreement versions.
