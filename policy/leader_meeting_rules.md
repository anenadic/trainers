first section below describes these rules; the second lists voting members of
the project and explains how to become one, while the third lists decisions made
to date.

## Making Decisions

1.  Before each meeting, anyone who wishes may sponsor a proposal by filing an
    issue in the GitHub repository tagged "proposal".  Proposals must be filed
    at least 24 hours before a meeting in order to be considered at that
    meeting, and proposals will be assigned to milestones to indicate what meeting 
    they will be considered at. A proposal must include:
    -   a one-line summary (the subject line of the issue)
    -   the full text of the proposal
    -   any required background information
    -   pros and cons
    -   possible alternatives

2.  A quorum is established in a meeting if four or more of voting members are
    present.

3.  Once a person has sponsored a proposal, they are responsible for it.  The
    group may not discuss or vote on the issue unless the sponsor or their
    delegate is present.  The sponsor is also responsible for presenting the
    item to the group.

4.  After the sponsor presents the proposal, a sense vote is cast for the
    proposal prior to any discussion:
    -   Who likes the proposal?
    -   Who can live with the proposal?
    -   Who is uncomfortable with the proposal?

5.  If all of the group likes or can live with the proposal, it is immediately
    accepted with no further discussion.

6.  If most of the group is uncomfortable with the proposal, it is postponed for
    further rework by the sponsor.

7.  If any members are uncomfortable they can briefly state their objections.  A
    timer is then set for a brief discussion moderated by the facilitator.
    After 10 minutes or when no one has anything further to add (whichever comes
    first), the facilitator calls for a yes-or-no vote on the question: "Should
    we implement this decision over the stated objections?"  If a majority votes
    "yes" the proposal is implemented.  Otherwise, the proposal is returned to
    the sponsor for further work.

## Suffrage

1.  The following people are currently voting members of this project:
    -   Arindam Basu

2.  To become a voting member:
    1.  [Members must be elected](https://github.com/carpentries/trainers/blob/main/governance.md#nominations-and-elections)

3.  Voting members may resign from the project at any time, or [be removed](https://github.com/carpentries/trainers/blob/main/governance.md#removal).  For 2021-2022 term, consideration for removal occurs after 3 unexplained no-shows. 

## Recording Decisions


Accepted proposals will be linked to in the associated meeting minutes. Proposals may involve adding resources to this repository, these proposals' issues should be closed when the the pull request for the addition is merged.  For proposals that do not involve adding resources, they may be closed when otherwise acted upon. 

## Leadership Panel Meeting Minutes

Meeting minutes will be added as a pull request by a submitter (secretary or delegate) and all members of the panel will review and approve the pull request.  The minutes will be merged for record after all voting members have approved the current version, any member who was not last to approve or Core Team members may merge minutes.
