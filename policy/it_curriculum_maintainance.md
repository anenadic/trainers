# Instructor Training Curriculum Maintainance

This document describes how the Carpentries Community maintains the instructor training curriculum.  
Because this curriculum is taught by a select group of individuals and serves as an entrypoint for 
instructors who teach other curricula for The Carpentries, maintainance of the IT curriculum involves
a greater number of stakeholders.  

The IT curriculum does not have a standard Curriculum Advisory Committee, there is the whole trainer 
community and their elected leadership panel. 

## Role of Maintainers 

- certify as maintainers for the carpentries 
- (regular maintainer duties, via pointer?) 
- refer issues for trainer discussion
- provide consistent peer review during major updates 
## Maintainer Selection

In addition to the Core Team IT Team, there should be at least X trainers as maintainers. 

One member of the leadership panel should participate as a maintainer and, with the Core Team
faciliate updates between the two groups. 

## Changes requiring input outside of maintainers
