# Instructor Training Curriculum Maintainance

This document describes how the Carpentries Community maintains the Instructor Training (IT) Curriculum.  
Because this curriculum is taught by a select group of individuals and serves as an entrypoint for 
instructors who teach other curricula for The Carpentries, maintainance of the IT curriculum involves
a greater number of stakeholders.  

The IT curriculum does not have a standard Curriculum Advisory Committee. Instead an elected leadership panel
fulfills this role and solicits feedback from the whole community of trainers as needed. 

## Definitions 

**Patches** are typo fixes and in situ rearticulations of paragraphs to improve clarity. There's no change in lesson or in-episode order and there is no expectation that notice needs to be given to trainers preparing to run a workshop. 

**Minor updates** are PRs from issues that make changes to a single conceptual component of the curriculum, even if it addresses multiple issues to multiple sections of the curriculum. These changes may require a change to how a trainer prepares to teach, but do not substantially change key points or the order of materials. 

**Major updates** are updates that make multiple conceptual changes or change the key points of episodes. This includes PRs that resolve multiple interdependent issues; represent significant changes in terminology or framing; change which topics are covered or substantially reorder material. 

## Role of Maintainers 

- perform routine maintenance duties as [outlined by the Maintainer community](https://carpentries.github.io/maintainer-onboarding/05-communicate-advisors/index.html)
- refer issues to Trainer community for discussion
- provide peer review during major updates (see below)
- recruit and delegate to individuals or focus groups to collaborate on specific topics or tasks of interest
- complete certification as a Carpentries Maintainer as possible and practical

PR Handling:
- Patches may be merged by any maintainer without discussion. 
- Minor changes can be merged by any maintainer who did not contribute to the PR or after discussion among maintainers.
- Changes to policy must be approved by the trainer leadership panel and linked to a proposal in that group. 
- The Core Team curriculum team supports the list of starting points for teaching demonstrations. 
- Maintainers may request using a trainer meeting to discuss proposals to the currciulum that 
  represent a significant change.  
- Organizational and structural changes follow the major update process below. 

## Maintainer Selection

This group should consist of at least 3 people:
- 1 designated member of The Carpentries Core Team
- 1 member of Trainers Leadership
- 1 additional Trainer

At least one member of this group should be certified as a Carpentries Maintainer, trainers
may be appointed prior to certification, but will take steps to complete that certification
upon appointment.  The Trainers leadership shall approve appointments to the maintainer 
committee each year. Additional maintainers may be added at any time by recommendation of
the existing maintainers with approval of the leadership panel. 

## Special Maintance Procedures/Sections
