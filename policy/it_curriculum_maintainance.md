# Instructor Training Curriculum Maintainance

This document describes how the Carpentries Community maintains the instructor training curriculum.  
Because this curriculum is taught by a select group of individuals and serves as an entrypoint for 
instructors who teach other curricula for The Carpentries, maintainance of the IT curriculum involves
a greater number of stakeholders.  

The IT curriculum does not have a standard Curriculum Advisory Committee, there is the whole trainer 
community and their elected leadership panel. 

## Role of Maintainers 

- perform routine maintenance duties as [outlined by the Maintainer community](https://carpentries.github.io/maintainer-onboarding/05-communicate-advisors/index.html)
- refer issues to Trainer community for discussion
- provide peer review during major updates (see below)
- recruit and delegate to individuals or focus groups to collaborate on specific topics or tasks of interest
- complete certification as a Carpentries Maintainer as possible and practical

## Maintainer Selection

This group should consist of at least 3 people:
- 1 designated member of The Carpentries Core Team
- 1 member of Trainers Leadership
- 1 additional Trainer

At least one member of this group should be certified as a Carpentries Maintainer.
