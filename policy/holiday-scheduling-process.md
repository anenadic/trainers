# Scheduling: Trainers Meetings and Holidays

## Rationale

Regularly scheduled bi-monthly meetings of Carpentries Trainers may fall on a 
major holiday, reducing participation by the trainers community. Given the 
global distribution of Carpentries Trainers, and variation in observance of 
major holidays, the degree to which any particular holiday will impact trainer 
meeting collision is difficult to predict. 

## Responsibilities

+ The decision to cancel a regularly scheduled trainers meeting will be at the 
discretion of the Carpentries' Director of Instructor Training or a designated proxy. 
+ Notification of such a cancellation should be made at least 72 hours before the
scheduled meeting time through all normal meeting announcement communication channels. 
+ The Carpentries Trainers community will be responsible for notifying the 
Director of Instructor Training of significant holidays that conflict with 
regularly scheduled trainer meetings.
