## Bonny Adane Bayissa
### Briefly, describe your experience with The Carpentries and/or Carpentries-related activities. 
I have been with the carpentries community for the past 4 years as an instructor and have became a trainer in late 2021. I have instructed in more than 15 data carpentry workshops and had a session for an instructor training on the carpentrycon.    

### If you have previously served on Trainers Leadership, please use this space to share a few things about your past service in this role.
I have not served yet :)

### Why do you want to serve on a Trainers Leadership panel?
I would like to take more responsibilities in the carpentries and I have an issue to raise if it could be approved.  

### How would you describe your approach or philosophy of service in this role?
As my past leadership roles in different organizations, my philosophy is serving the community. This includes following the majority rule minority right philosophy and balancing it with the organizations mission and vision. This will create a happy and engaged community. Happy community = successful organization.         

### What is one issue that you would like to take on in your leadership term and why do you think it is important?
Increasing the skill sets of trainers in relation to data which could help them in the market and increasing an experience sharing platforms.   
	
### How do you expect to engage in addressing the issues you find most important?	
By communicating the issues on meetings with a well structured action plan and taking comments an the issue as well as the action plan. 

### Is there anything else you would like to share with the community?


## Jon Wheeler
### Briefly, describe your experience with The Carpentries and/or Carpentries-related activities. 
I am involved with the Carpentries community in several ways. My first experience with the Carpentries was as a helper at a Software Carpentry in 2015. I was very impressed by the engagement of the learners and openness of the instructors at that event, and after experiencing those qualities again as a learner at a Data Carpentry, I was excited to become an instructor in 2019. Since then I have taught several workshops, in person and online, and am additionally responsible for recruiting instructors and hosting workshops through UNM's institutional membership. I became an instructor trainer in 2021, and am also currently developing a lesson in the incubator.

### If you have previously served on Trainers Leadership, please use this space to share a few things about your past service in this role.

### Why do you want to serve on a Trainers Leadership panel?
I would like to learn more about governance within the Carpentries, and to contribute what I can to a community that has enriched my work life. Being an instructor and an instructor trainer has helped me become more effective in my other duties, and I'm continually impressed by the enthusiasm and engagement of this large community of volunteers. I've benefited greatly from my involvement with the Carpentries, and I'd like to support the community so that others can maximize the benefits of this opportunity as well.

### How would you describe your approach or philosophy of service in this role?
In all of my service activities, but especially those in which I have any kind of leadership role, my goal is to build consensus around initiatives and solutions that best provide a collective benefit to the members of a community or organization. Specifically, the values and practices through which I approach this goal are primarily my commitments to shared governance and transparent decision making. Though I am comfortable making decisions, what I most appreciate is the opportunity to develop a communal vision and strategic outcomes through conversation and collaboration.

### What is one issue that you would like to take on in your leadership term and why do you think it is important?	
My experience coordinating UNM's Carpentries membership has caused me to reflect a lot on the sustainability of statewide and regional Carpentries initiatives that are often dependent on grant funding. The membership team is very responsive and the new membership tiers demonstrate flexibility and commitment to the community, but at some point the funding for continued membership is likely to end. From a trainer's perspective, I'm interested in exploring ways to build sustainability and support the growth of these decentralized Carpentry-seeded networks, during and after membership. Creating additional paths for trainers and instructors to remain active and involved in the Carpentries seems like a good way to leverage the mutual benefits of membership for the long term.
	
### How do you expect to engage in addressing the issues you find most important?	
I expect to engage in this and other issues through communication and assessment. As noted above, I believe collaboration and collective decision making are key. I would first aim to develop a better understanding of the big picture through the available technical and instructor training workshop survey results, annual reports, and other resources. But as soon as possible I would want to start facilitating structured, strategic conversations around issues of importance to the trainer community. In addition to the monthly trainer meetings, we can create dialogue through themed community discussions and other channels including the Carpentries Slack and Topicbox.

### Is there anything else you would like to share with the community?
Thinking these questions through has been a valuable opportunity for me to consider areas in which I'd like to develop as an instructor and trainer, and to what extent my personal goals align with those of the broader community. I look forward to learning more, and clarifying my understanding of how we operate and might best evolve together.


## Paola Corrales
### Briefly, describe your experience with The Carpentries and/or Carpentries-related activities. 
I became a Carpentries Trainer and Instructor in March 2020. Since then I co-organised and taught 2 Instructor Training workshops in Spanish (in 2020 and 2021), hosted by  MetaDocencia, with participants from Argentina, México, Ecuador, and Uruguay, where more than 80% have completed their checkout. I regularly host Teaching Demo and Discussion sessions in Spanish to support the Spanish-speaking community to complete the certification in the same language. Along with my “formal” involvement, I also teach coding, visualizations, and data management at Universidad Guillermo Brown and Universidad de Buenos Aires where I use Carpentries’ teaching strategies and lesson materials and spread the word about the community. 

### If you have previously served on Trainers Leadership, please use this space to share a few things about your past service in this role.

### Why do you want to serve on a Trainers Leadership panel?
Being part of the Trainers community for a few years now, I believe I can help to keep building and improving the community and support the work and effort of all its members. Moreover, I would like to bring a different perspective from a region where The Carpentries is not widely spread but it could highly benefit. 

### How would you describe your approach or philosophy of service in this role?
My approach to this role is that, while I’ll bring my own ideas, and perspective, I also won’t forget that *I’m representing* others. So, I would commit to not only listening but seeking others' ideas and opinions.

### What is one issue that you would like to take on in your leadership term and why do you think it is important?
One issue I’ll like to work on is developing a policy around sponsorship of Instructor Training seats and events. I understand that memberships and sponsorships play an important role in the growth and sustainability of The Carpentries. For me, it is important to think about this problem from different points of view. From a global point of view, taking into account the needs of the organization as a whole, the commitments, and responsibilities with other institutions and organizations. And from a more regional point of view, thinking about building and supporting local Carpentries communities that help to improve education and science in their region. 
	
### How do you expect to engage in addressing the issues you find most important?	
Firstly, I'd like to learn from previous Leadership Team members' experience and advice to approach the different issues. Secondly, I will actively ask the rest of the community for feedback and opinions on the various issues being addressed. I believe that we should take into account and benefit from the trainer's diverse experience and situations to come up with solutions that include everyone.

### Is there anything else you would like to share with the community?


## Mark Crowe
### Briefly, describe your experience with The Carpentries and/or Carpentries-related activities. 
I have been a Carpentries Instructor since February 2020 and a Trainer since December 2020. Over the last two years I have organised 40 Carpentries workshops across Queensland, attended by around 900 learners. I served on the Trainers Leadership panel in 2021, and I'm actively engaged in the Carpentries community in Australia and work with many colleagues around the country to support Carpentries activities.

### If you have previously served on Trainers Leadership, please use this space to share a few things about your past service in this role.
I have attended Leadership panel meetings consistently over the year and been actively involved in all discussions. In particular, I led a project to seek feedback from the community about an update of the Trainer Agreement. I have contributed to the oversight of the redevelopment of the Instructor training syllabus, ensuring that all Trainers had plenty of opportunity to review the new content and to give feedback, and confirming that feedback was acted on. I've attended most monthly Trainer meetings as a representative of the Leadership panel, to pass on information and answer questions about panel discussions.

### Why do you want to serve on a Trainers Leadership panel?
I am a strong advocate of the Carpentries Instructor training program and want to support its 
continued expansion. I recognise that this puts great demands on the relatively small Trainer community who freely volunteer their time and effort to deliver this program, and I want to further improve engagement and consultation of the Trainer group by the Carpentries core team and Executive Council.

Since its formation 11 months ago, the Leadership panel has devoted a lot of effort into getting established and clarifying its activities and responsibilities. I feel that in 2022 the panel will have the opportunity to really build on this groundwork and start making more of a difference for the Trainer community, and I would like to be involved in this work.

### How would you describe your approach or philosophy of service in this role?
The Carpentries has been very valuable to me in my work role, and I want to give back to the community that has made this possible. I feel that one of the best ways I can do this is by supporting and representing Trainers, who are at the heart of the Carpentries community and culture 

### What is one issue that you would like to take on in your leadership term and why do you think it is important?	
Over the last year, there have been improvements in communication between Trainers and the Carpentries management groups, but I believe that there is still room for improvement, and I would like to continue to push for further engagement and consultation. This is important to me because Trainers are fundamental to the Carpentries, being responsible for delivering Instructor training (one of the Carpentries main selling points) but I feel that communication issues mean that the Carpentries aren't getting the full benefit of the experience and knowledge of the Trainer community.
	
### How do you expect to engage in addressing the issues you find most important?	
I would use the (bi-)monthly Trainer meetings to encourage the Trainer community to raise topics they would like the Leadership panel to follow up on, and to have the panel focus more on these than internally identified topics in future (although the latter was important last year, when there were a lot of administrative activities to be completed to establish the panel).

## Jeff Oliver
### Briefly, describe your experience with The Carpentries and/or Carpentries-related activities. 
Since joining The Carpentries trainers team in 2017, I have had the pleasure to work with other members of the team on over a dozen Instructor Training workshops. These workshops, along with hosting teaching demonstrations, is where I currently focus most of my efforts with The Carpentries. In 2021, I was elected to the Trainers Leadership, where I helped define roles and expectations of the group (more details below). I have also been an instructor for Library Carpentry and R-flavored Software Carpentry workshops and help maintain the R for Reproducible Scientific Analyses lesson. In my own work, I direct two graduate fellowship programs that provide pedagogical training to graduate students, who in turn support data science and digital scholarship in their respective fields. The programs are designed to improve representation and support for computational and data literacy in historically underserved communities. I also provide instruction in the R programming language and occasionally muddle my way through the semantic whitespace of Python.

### If you have previously served on Trainers Leadership, please use this space to share a few things about your past service in this role.
Much of my work on Trainers Leadership was to help define how the group operates, with a focus on transparency and efficiency. As Secretary for the group, I maintained meeting minutes and helped create a balanced procedure to ensure privacy where warranted while being transparent about the group’s activities and discussions. I also participated in revisions to the Trainer Certification Renewal process, in order to align with expectations and capacity based on feedback from the trainers community (to be clear, I *helped* with this process, Karen Word really shouldered the bulk of this effort). Finally, in recognition of the global trainers community, I created an explicit policy detailing responsibilities and processes for deciding when to cancel regularly scheduled trainers meetings due to conflict with observance of a major holiday.

### Why do you want to serve on a Trainers Leadership panel?
The Trainers Leadership panel would provide an opportunity to evangelize broadly for the pedagogical best-practices detailed in the Instructor Training curriculum. I would like to identify opportunities to improve access to this curriculum. The Carpentries philosophy has much to offer towards widespread computational and data literacy - making this more accessible is what drives my interest in continuing to serve on Trainers Leadership.

### How would you describe your approach or philosophy of service in this role?
The guiding principle for my service in this role is to listen. Trainers Leadership works best when we make decisions based on input from the trainers community - this was especially important in revising the Trainer Certification Renewal process. I also value the perspectives and opinions of other members of the Trainers Leadership group; I believe we were able to make more meaningful decisions when working as a respectful, collaborative collective. Finally, the guidance provided by the Directors of Instructor Training gave us important context for the directions we took and efforts we invested in. By serving as *representative* leader, I aim to serve to the benefit of the trainers community and The Carpentries as a whole.

### What is one issue that you would like to take on in your leadership term and why do you think it is important?	
The global demand for data and computational skills training is growing, and The Carpentries will continue to play an integral role in meeting that demand. I think it is an opportune time to consider how to increase trainer participation in Instructor Training events. Such increased participation would allow The Carpentries to better serve broader audiences, through formal Carpentry workshops and a more general, global increase in awareness of effective and accessible pedagogy.
	
### How do you expect to engage in addressing the issues you find most important?	
Are trainers constrained by time? Do certain formats work better for trainers? For learners? Working with Carpentries leadership, I would collect information on strengths and weaknesses of different training formats to identify opportunities for increased trainer participation. Based on this information, I would work with the rest of Trainers Leadership and the Directors of Instructor Training to determine what might be done, especially to engage trainers in areas of critical need.

### Is there anything else you would like to share with the community?
I am grateful for having had the opportunity to serve on Trainers Leadership for the past year and look forward to continuing my work with the Carpentries.

## Sarah Brown
### Briefly, describe your experience with The Carpentries and/or Carpentries-related activities. 
I have been an instructor since late 2017 and a trainer since early 2019. I have not been a part of active local carpentries communities, but I have taught at a number of other institutions (New York University, University of California San Fransisco, Carnegie Melon, Carpentry Con Johannesburg and open online instructor trainings) in addition to some self organized events (University of Rhode Island, University of California Berkeley, Brown University) . I have served on the lesson infrastructure committee, the trainer's adhoc committee and the trainer's leadership. I have also developed a lesson in the incubator and completed the maintainer training.  I was previously a maintainer on the social science openrefine lesson and I currently am a maintainer for instructor training.  

### If you have previously served on Trainers Leadership, please use this space to share a few things about your past service in this role.
I served on the adhoc precurso in addition to being elected to this first year of the trainer leadership panel.  I joined the maintainer subcommittee in this capacity and I have d additionally served as chair.  In this way, I led the group by preparing agendas and ensuring that we are communicating with the larger trainer community.  I authored a number of proposals to initiate work that fleshed out policies we needed in order to operate efficiently and transparently. 

### Why do you want to serve on a Trainers Leadership panel?
I enjoy the trainer community and want to continue to finish work that we started and begin to work within the structure we created in this first year to shift toward more community focused elements. After serving as chair for the past year I would like to serve in a more chair emeritus role to support continuity for the group while simultaneously encouraging new leadership and new ideas.  

### How would you describe your approach or philosophy of service in this role?
My philosophy will continue to be focused on transparent leadership, but with a renewed focus on oversight rather than open brainstorming as a means of input.  This year we learned that open calls for input receive less attention than requests for revision and I want to use that insight to build momentum for this community to thrive. 

### What is one issue that you would like to take on in your leadership term and why do you think it is important?	
We have made big changes to the certification renewal and I would like to make sure that this roles out smoothly and that appropriate initial (minor) revisions are made.  My goal for the certification renewal is that it helps ensure that our trainees receive consistent high quality training that enables any instructor to coteach with any other instructor easily, while also supporting trainers in engaging with the Carpentries as we can.  This is a hard line to draw, but I think an important one. 
	
### How do you expect to engage in addressing the issues you find most important?	
I want to make sure that we are able to communicate clearly that we want to retain trainers through their various needs.  With that, I think closer attention to how certification reactivation can be designed and if it requires additional support beyond the core team will be an important feature to work through.

## Arindam Basu
### Briefly, describe your experience with The Carpentries and/or Carpentries-related activities. 
Seven years as instructor, Six years as a trainer and I am one of the first batch of trainers in Australia and New Zealand, conducted numerous formal (i.e., workshops that are listed in the Carpentries register) and informal workshops, early adopter of using Carpentries workshop in university education; 

### If you have previously served on Trainers Leadership, please use this space to share a few things about your past service in this role.
Steered and guided discussions on "redact" principles as to which parts of the discussions should be included and excluded in the reports, participated end edited drafts of trainer agreement documentation. Most of my work has been at the level of participating and guiding discussions on the several issues of policy and principles of governance of the Trainers group. 

### Why do you want to serve on a Trainers Leadership panel?
A lot of work remains to make the trainers' group as such to be truly representative of the world to bring the benefit of Carpentries to as many people in the world as we can. The Carpentries has grown from a niche workshop based preparation of educators and practitioners of computational tools (such as computational biology, computational social science, and so forth), to a worldwide impactful agency that enables researchers and academics worldwide to accomplish things using networked and desktop computers. As the scope of the work of The Carpentries continue to grow, ""trainers"" in this ecosystem will play a pivotal role. Carpentries still need to be adopted widely in the Global South; we have seen impressive growth in Oceania, but Pacific countries lag behind. 
With these thoughts in mind, if I get a chance to serve on the Trainers leadership panel again, I will focus on the following areas:
* Identify and characterise the geographical areas and thematic areas where Carpentries can expand
* Focus on how we can get more trainers from the Global South; What models can we adopt to translate and grow Carpentries 
* What are other areas where we need more trainers and modules, such as blockchains, and NFT minting where there is a need for skilled people, some academic and research is going on, but many people are unsure as to how handle blockchain transactions or even what they mean: this is an area where Carpentries style training _may_ be worthwhile; what will determine that discussion and going forward? Are we ready or even relevant for a blockchain Carpentry?

These issues are beyond group discussions and need to be deliberated keeping in mind the active development in the field of computational approaches to handling knowledge work. 

### How would you describe your approach or philosophy of service in this role?
My philosophy of service is rooted in three principles:
1) Listen more, listen actively: A leader, in my view is the person, who brings up the rank that moves slowest, so the team moves as a whole. This involves _paying attention_ to even the most _trivial_ contribution in the pool of knowledge or contribution in the group. In turn, this behooves that the leader must actively listen. Listen with the intent of understanding, not with the intent of responding
2) Develop deep empathy: See the world from the other person's perspective; slow, deliberate, unhurried deep understanding of all perspectives. This is particularly important for a global group in the trainers leadership where we have a mix of experiences and academic and industry leaders and novices, but each bring in unique perspectives. Without deep empathy, it is impossible to understand this complex world.
3) Do: Getting things done, then check and obtain feedback. 

### What is one issue that you would like to take on in your leadership term and why do you think it is important?	
One issue that I'd like to see taken on in my leadership team would be ""advancing community governance structures"". The community of The Carpentries is growing and will continue to grow and expand in many directions over the coming years. At the same time, the realities of the world is changing. For example, in 2019, The Carpentries was growing in Oceania, and participation in videoconferencing networks for all members were encouraged with few online training sessions. In 2020 and beyond, online Carpentries workshop went mainstream and matured because of the pressure from COVID19 and its aftermath. What structures and processes within the Carpentries were able to withstand the pressure of the changing world and what structures and processes were able to steer the new growth and trajectories? More specifically, as these changes affected the global community of Carpentries institutions, instructors, trainers, maintainers, and as ""trainers"" are the ""lynchpins"" of the effectiveness of Carpentries network, this would mean that a robust, scalable community governance structure would be necessary for the sustainability of the Carpentries not only as an institution but also as a movement.

In the coming years, these pressures will continue to grow and a successful organisation and its sustainability will be defined how well the governance structures can function and serve the need of the organisation in face of uncertainties and shifts many of which are unforeseen. 
	
### How do you expect to engage in addressing the issues you find most important?	
If I were to lead in the community governance structure space, I would:'
* Treat it like a journey and ""map the terrain"", so
* Convene a group that would be representative of the different disciplinary interest and geographical regions where Carpentries has grown and will continue to grow
* Map out what structures and processes are serving the community well and consolidate them (example: an excellent communication framework that already exists through github repositories and discussions, Slack, Topicbox, and others), understand where we are not doing well (example: who are not happy and why not, where are we falling back, why and where the codes of conduct are not working and why)
* Ask the right questions based on consensus but also robust discussions and make the process transparent so that as many people as possible can join and discuss
* Plan and implement plans and protocols based on the evidence generated. 
* Generate an information and feedback gathering process and analyse them for next actions.

### Is there anything else you would like to share with the community?
Not at this stage, to stay focused.
