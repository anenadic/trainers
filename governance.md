#### Nominations and Elections

All Instructor Trainers with Active status will be eligible to vote in elections.

New Members will be elected each year as vacancies occur. A general timeline for elections will occur annually as follows:
* Mid November: The Committee identifies a point of contact for the election. This person should not be standing for re-election.
* Early December: Elections announced, Self-nominations open
* Mid January: Self-nominations close, entries posted, dedicated Trainer meeting held to introduce candidates
* Late January: Trainers vote 
* March 1: Responsibility transferred to new Members

If the seat of a Member becomes vacant after March 1 but before December 1, the Committee will attempt to fill the seat with a non-elected nominee from the most recent election, in the order of votes received. If this fails, the Committee may appoint any Active Trainer to fill the seat until the next election.

Elections will be conducted using a [Single Transferable Vote](https://electionbuddy.com/features/voting-systems/stv-voting) (STV) preferential selection system. 
In the event that more than 15 eligible candidates self-nominate for election, a primary using the same system will be held first, with the top 10 candidates 
standing for final election.


## Ratification and Governance

This document will go into effect when a first election of leadership takes place.

Changes to this document may come from the leadership or the trainer community. 
To make changes:

1. The trainer community should be notified one week prior to a regularly scheduled 
trainer meeting that the meeting topic will be changes to trainer leadership. The 
notificaiton must include the changes to be discussed and an asynchronous means for
engagement.
1. After the dedicated meeting, an additional one week to comment and propose revisions
to the change. 
1. After the two week comment period, a proposal moves to a vote among all trainers.
A proposal is adopted with a quorum of 2/3 trainers in good standing voting (for,against, 
or abstain) and a simple majority of the votes in favor.
