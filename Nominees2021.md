## Jeff Oliver
### Briefly, describe your experience with The Carpentries and/or Carpentries-related activities.	
Since joining The Carpentries trainers team in 2017, I have had the pleasure to work with other members of the team on over a dozen Instructor Training workshops. These workshops, along with hosting teaching demonstrations, is where I currently focus most of my efforts with The Carpentries. I have also been an instructor for Library Carpentry and R-flavored Software Carpentry workshops and help maintain the R for Reproducible Scientific Analyses lesson. In my own work, I direct two graduate fellowship programs that provide pedagogical training to graduate students, who in turn support data science and digital scholarship in their respective fields. I also provide instruction in the R programming language and can teach Python with minimal attempts at one-based indexing.	
### Why do you want to serve on a Trainers Leadership panel?
The Trainers Leadership panel would provide an opportunity to evangelize broadly for the pedagogical best-practices detailed in the Instructor Training curriculum. I would like to identify collaboration opportunities to improve access to this curriculum. Computational and data literacy for all.	
### What is one issue that you would like to take on in your leadership term and why do you think it is important?	
Developing policy around sponsorship of Instructor Training seats and events is of primary interest to me. There is a growth opportunity in Instructor Training seats and I would like to find creative solutions to offer more of these training events to broader audiences. As interest in data and computational skills continues to grow, so too does the need for instructors qualified to provide training in these areas. How can The Carpentries help address this need sensu lato?	
### How do you expect to engage in addressing the issues you find most important?	
To address training needs, I would, first and foremost, reach out to current Trainers Leadership, along with the general Trainers population, to find out what works and what does not. I would solicit input on additional training schedules (4 half-day sessions?, 4 instructors [2 per day] for a 2 day event?) to maximize the impact of Trainers’ volunteer efforts. Following this, I would work with other Trainer Leadership panel members and the Carpentries Core team to identify and implement realistic solutions.	
### Is there anything else you would like to share with the community?
You folks are great.

## Amanda Charbonneau

### Briefly, describe your experience with The Carpentries and/or Carpentries-related activities.
I took my first Software Carpentries course in 2012, and began TAing and teaching for SC soon after. When Data Carpentry started, I helped write several of the initial genomics episodes and pilot those new lessons; and I am still a maintainer on that project. In fall of 2020, I completed the  Instructor Trainers training, and recently co-taught my first cohort of instructors.	
### Why do you want to serve on a Trainers Leadership panel?
I have a keen interest in community building, and have served in leadership roles both for my professional work and in organizations where I have volunteered over the last twenty years. Creating organizational structures that enhance the community experience for members is challenging, as what works is highly dependent on the the goals of the organization and the culture of its people. However, it's also really rewarding when you get it right. I'm excited to engage with the training community and start working on building governance that gives trainers the support they need without getting in their way.	
### What is one issue that you would like to take on in your leadership term and why do you think it is important?
Currently, I am most interested in the Trainer Agreement and how it shapes the community. A well written 'rules of engagement' document is incredibly useful for both an organization and its volunteers. It gives volunteers the ability to access the organization and their place in it. For the organization, it can reduce the burden on volunteer management, and even out some of the uncertainty that comes with having a largely volunteer staff. But, the rules and guidelines written into such agreements also become the manifestation of the organizations values and goals. I think what we have now is a very good start. Creating policy like this takes a huge amount of effort, and I'm sure the current document represents dozens of hours of work. However, in trainer meetings where The Carpentries solicited feedback about the new agreement, it was clear that there are some mismatches between what the organization values, and what messages members were getting from the text. I think these perceived mismatches are really important to address, and a good place for the leadership team to start.	
### How do you expect to engage in addressing the issues you find most important?
I'm really interested in evaluating the current Trainer Agreement in terms of what goals it is trying to accomplish, and what values are inherent in the way it tries to accomplish them. I'd like to revisit the feedback about the document, and to solicit more. At the same time, I'd like to get a clear list of the goals of the agreement, and to order them by importance. Finally, I'd like to work on edits to address the most important goals and to ensure that they align with the Carpentries values, and are expressed in a way that resonates with the community.	
### Is there anything else you would like to share with the community?
I'm excited to meet (and teach with) more of you in 2021!

## Arindam Basu
### Briefly, describe your experience with The Carpentries and/or Carpentries-related activities.
I am an instructor, and a trainer for the last three years. I have conducted several workshops at the University of Canterbury and trained instructors across New Zealand and Australia. I have actively participated in the discussions of the trainers group and focused largely on Australia and New Zealand running workshops for trainee instructors both offline and online in different formats (live face to face two day formats and online four day formats). I have actively participated at the eResearchNZ2020 (and due to attend eResearchNZ2021) on Carpentries sessions. I have ported the Carpentries model to University teaching and in the process helped to induct university academics to become Carpentries instructors, for whom, then I organised further workshops. So, in summary, my work as a Carpentries instructor and trainer spans and bridges various elements. On the one hand, I have participated in formal instruction and training of instructors; on the other, by modelling The Carpentries as a model of instruction in my OWN practice, I have created an awareness and interest in my own university community and then inducted them to The Carpentries. I’d say this is my unique contribution where I have integrated The Carpentries in my professional lives and created a community of practitioners at the University of Canterbury.	
### Why do you want to serve on a Trainers Leadership panel?
Having served on the trainers leadership panel for a year, I have the impression that we at the trainers leadership panel will benefit from diversity: for example, I belong to Australia-New Zealand (Oceania community), but I also have connections with the Indian user base. So a person such as myself will bring in diversity and can contribute to expansion of the Carpentries in regions of the world where The Carpentries needs to expand further. From the first principles, The Carpentries is about innovation, productivity, efficient use of the technology, and we envisage that in 2021 and beyond, it will expand far and wide and touch areas (figuratively and geographically) that so far has remain untapped. Further, there is a need to connect the various spaces together. This is an area that I’d like to focus on as a member of the trainers leadership panel: build and consolidate new and existing connections and network of the Carpentries worldwide and with diverse communities across the world. 	
### What is one issue that you would like to take on in your leadership term and why do you think it is important?
Of the various areas outlined, the one that I’d like to focus will be the one on Instructor training seats and events. As instructor training is at the core of The Carpentries. On the one hand, instructor training sets up the “flow" of activity in The Carpentries; on the other hand, it influences the lives of the academics and researcher community. In turn, seats and events are issues that determine the structure and process of this “engine” if you will. How well we coordinate all of these worldwide and with increasing adoption of new technology and uncertainties as we head into a possible post-covid scenarios of education and training, will be critical for the community. Hence, I’d like to bring in my experiences and expertise to this particular domain. 	
### How do you expect to engage in addressing the issues you find most important?
I’d like to utilise all the existing available ways to engage in addressing these issues. Where possible, particularly within the context of New Zealand and Australia, engaging in face to face transactions with fellow members. Where possible and necessary, engaging in online video conferencing with members, and using the other channels (Slack, Github issues), and others.  	
### Is there anything else you would like to share with the community?
Nothing specific at this time.

## Sarah Brown
### Briefly, describe your experience with The Carpentries and/or Carpentries-related activities.
I have been a certified instructor since 2017 and a certified trainer since 2019.  I have also served on the lesson infrastructure committee. I've taught centrally organized workshops at University of California San Fransisco, New York University and self organized workshops at UC Berkeley.  As a trainer, I've taught online and in person at Carnegie Mellon.  I am a maintainer for the Data Carpentry Social Science Openrefine lesson, a Carpentries Incubator lesson on Python Packaging and Publishing, and the Instructor trainer curriculum. 	
### Why do you want to serve on a Trainers Leadership panel?
I want to serve on a Trainer Leadership panel in order to build our community. The carpentries community as a whole is something that I greatly enjoy and as trainers we get to lead the onboarding of new members of our community. I want to lead the trainer community to create transparent procedures and policy around how we run trainings.   I am excited about creating structure because it will mean that we can spend more time as a community discussing the content of our curriculum. 	
### What is one issue that you would like to take on in your leadership term and why do you think it is important?
Completing the governance construction is an important issue for me to complete in this term because it will set the community up for success. Governance is important for me because as our community grows consensus is not always feasible.  Too many decisions need to be made to involve all trainers in each one.  By creating a transparent, complete, values-driven governance structure we can maintain the values and qualities of the Carpentries that are the foundation of our community while still streamlining processes so that they scale. 	
### How do you expect to engage in addressing the issues you find most important?
I expect to engage in these issues by first working with the leadership group to create a process for internal asynchronous work and for evaluating what we want. On governance specifically, after the leadership panel organizes ideas into specific questions, I would want to solicit community feedback prior to approval. I would strive to leave space for any in the community who wish to participate while also moving the process forward so that the governance can support the community without burdening the community. 	

## Luca Di Stasio
### Briefly, describe your experience with The Carpentries and/or Carpentries-related activities.
I'm a certified Instructor and Trainer. I taught several workshops in person and online. I'm actively contributing to the creation of a local Italian Carpentries community. Contributed to lessons and to the CarpentriesCon@ Home 2020.	
### Why do you want to serve on a Trainers Leadership panel?
To bring the perspective of a novice Trainer with a varied background (Italian working in Saudi Arabia doing research in engineering).	The Trainer agreement and sponsorship of Instructor training seats. I believe there is a tension between trainers who are 100% volunteers and those that are somehow sponsored. 
### What is one issue that you would like to take on in your leadership term and why do you think it is important?
The Trainer agreement does not address this issue and sponsorship for instructor training seats should be better defined to allow volunteers to have a chance at becoming somehow "sponsored" (i.e. as a negotiating tool to achieve a better balance between formal employment and Carpentries involvement).	
### How do you expect to engage in addressing the issues you find most important?
Gathering feedback on the issue from the community through questionnaire(s) and community calls, proposing changes and improvements to be implemented in the Trainer agreement and Carpentries policy around sponsorship.	

## Mark Crowe
### Briefly, describe your experience with The Carpentries and/or Carpentries-related activities.
I have been in my current role for just over 18 months. During that time I have qualified as both a Carpentries Instructor and Instructor Trainer. Last year I organised 20 Carpentries workshops attended by 560 learners, delivered by a team of over 25 instructors and helpers, and covering seven universities across 1700km. I have recently negotiated for my organisation to upgrade from Silver to Platinum membership of the Carpentries. I'm actively engaged in the Carpentries community in Australia and work with many colleagues around the country to support Carpentries activities.	
### Why do you want to serve on a Trainers Leadership panel?
I am a big supporter of the Carpentries approach to training and want to help it to become even more widely adopted. But I recognise the demands this puts on the relatively small Trainer group and want to do my part to make sure that group is properly represented, engaged and consulted	
### What is one issue that you would like to take on in your leadership term and why do you think it is important?
Talking with Trainers who have been certified much longer than me, I gather that there is frustration with poor communication between Trainers and the Core Team; in some cases, this is even starting to impact on the trust and relationship between the two groups. Trainers are central to sustaining and growing the Carpentries community and contribute a lot of time and effort, so I think it's essential that these communication issues are addressed and Trainers can feel fully engaged and appreciated.	
### How do you expect to engage in addressing the issues you find most important?
The Leadership Panel is a good start to addressing communication barriers. Over my term I would like to make sure that as the panel gets established and settles into its role, it focuses on keeping communication and engagement a priority in every issue it addresses.	
### Is there anything else you would like to share with the community?
While I've been associated with the Carpentries for less than two years, I've been working in data science training since 2012 and as a data scientist / programmer for several years before that. I also have two sons at high school and am unreasonably excited that between them they are learning Python, Javascript, robotics, and computer networking this term - apparently we're a family of geeks!


## Alexander Konovalov
### Briefly, describe your experience with The Carpentries and/or Carpentries-related activities.
Instructor; Trainer; Mentor (2 rounds); Lesson author (https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/gap-lesson/)	
### Why do you want to serve on a Trainers Leadership panel?
I have seen the call for nominations at topicbox after being alerted that my region is underrepresented, and I thought that I may try to improve the balance. I am also interested in trying a new way to contribute to the Carpentries, different from what I've been doing before. I have regional connections with the UK and wider European Carpentries community, primarily through being a Fellow of the Software Sustainability Institute since 2014. This would help me to represent this community on a Trainers Leadership panel, if I will have a chance.	
### What is one issue that you would like to take on in your leadership term and why do you think it is important?
In addition to the above, it's helping our community to stay in touch through the pandemic. 	
### How do you expect to engage in addressing the issues you find most important?
Participate more actively in Trainers monthly meetings, as well as hosting teaching demos and community discussions, and passing gathered information to the panel.	
### Is there anything else you would like to share with the community?
As a mathematician by training, I'd like to see more Carpentries for mathematicians and more mathematicians among Carpenters. Every mathematician, whenever coding or not, should use version control for writing papers in LaTeX!
