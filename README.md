## 2022 Meeting Schedule

Trainer Community meetings are open only to members of the Trainer community and invited guests. Meeting times are listed on the [Community Calendar](https://carpentries.org/community/#community-events). 
Meeting topics may be proposed by any member of the community. To propose a meeting topic, please visit the [Discussions tab in this repository](discussions) and 
create a Discussion topic. In the text of your topic, please include a request to discuss at a Trainer meeting. You may wish to specify whether you 
think a short discussion (during a standard meeting after pre/post workshop conversations) or a dedicated meeting would be more appropriate. 
  
Primary meetings are always held; "As Needed" meetings are held only if there is a scheduled topic for that day. 
If you would like to propose cancellation of a scheduled meeting due to holidays or other widespread conflicts, please submit an [Issue](issues) 
with this request for consideration by Trainers Leadership.
